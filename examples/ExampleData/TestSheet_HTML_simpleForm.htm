<td align=left valign=top>Flynn was an overnight sensation in his first 
starring role, Captain Blood (1935). Quickly typecast as a swashbuckler,
 he followed it with The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936). After his appearance 
 as Miles Hendon in The Prince and the Pauper (1937), he was cast in his most 
celebrated role as Robin Hood in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), 
his first film in Technicolor. He went on to appear in The Dawn Patrol (1938)
 with David Niven, Dodge City (1939), The Sea Hawk (1940) and Adventures of 
 Don Juan (1948).
<br><br>While Flynn acknowledged his attraction to de Havilland, film historian
 Rudy Behlmer's assertions that they were romantically involved during the 
 filming of Robin Hood (see the Special Edition of Robin Hood on DVD, 2003) 
 have been disputed by de Havilland. In an interview for Turner Classic Movies, 
 she said that their relationship was platonic, mostly because Flynn was
 already married to Lili Damita.
